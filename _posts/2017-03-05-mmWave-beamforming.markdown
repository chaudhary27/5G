> Millimeter-wave frequencies have historically been considered unsuitable for mobile applications because of propagation losses at such high frequencies and the inability of mmW signals to propagate around obstacles. [FCC-15-128]

Technological advances holds promise in unlocking the potential of using mmW bands for mobile uses in a way that meets the need for flexible access to spectrum to improve bandwidth in constrained geographies.
