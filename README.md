## Getting the blog up and running

This blog is using Jekyll one of the most popular static site generation tools. 


### Installation on a Vagrant Ubuntu Machine

**Install Jekyll**

Install the Jekyll Gem

```
gem install jekyll
```

Then update the binary (if you don't do this it will say command-not-found if you run `jekyll` command):

```
rbenv rehash
```

### Running the blog

Clone your fork and in the directory run the command to start the server:

```
jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

The first time you run this command it will take a while to get loaded up.
